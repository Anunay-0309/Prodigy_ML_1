# 🏠 Prodigy ML Task 1 — House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## 📌 Task Description

**Goal:**  
Use Linear Regression to predict house prices based on the following features:
- Average Income
- Average House Age
- Average Number of Bedrooms
- Average Number of Bathrooms
- House Square Footage

**Dataset:**  
[USA_Housing.csv](./USA_Housing.csv)

---

## 🧾 What This Project Does

This project:
1. Loads the housing dataset.
2. Selects key features for prediction.
3. Trains a **Linear Regression** model.
4. Evaluates the model using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
5. Visualizes **Actual vs Predicted Prices** with a scatter plot.

---

## 📊 Results

- The scatter plot shows how accurately the model predicts house prices.
- Points close to the diagonal line mean better predictions.

Check the final plot in the [`plots/`](./plots) folder!

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Upload the **CSV** and **notebook** to Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Make sure the CSV is in the same folder (`./USA_Housing.csv`).
3. Run each cell step by step.
4. Check the performance metrics and the final plot.
